                “I've worked with Tim for over 3 years, and he's been performing in my band for the last 2 years - and
                possesses the rare double talent of being both a fantastic player and creative mind, and also is super
                organised & efficient. He's taken on the projects of our promotional videos, all the audio recording and
                video work, while also performing in them too - and they always turn out in a very impressive way, and
                finished very quickly as well. If you're looking for someone who's going to put in 100% all the time, is
                very organised, very efficient, and also a very advanced guitar player, you've got the right guy in Tim”<br>
                <i>– <b>Kieran McNamara</b>, manager of the Knots wedding band</i>
            </div>
            <div style="text-align: right; color: #BABABA;">
                “Tim is a versatile and highly skilled musician who seamlessly navigates diverse genres, from classical
                to jazz, pop, and rock, delivering outstanding performances. I've worked with Tim as a guitarist,
                arranger, composer, producer, and songwriter, and I can wholeheartedly recommend his services”<br>
                <i>– <b>Dr Mario Dobernig</b>, BA(Graz) BMus(Sibelius) MA(HU) MMus(Sibelius) MMus(Melbourne)

            <div>
                “Tim Lukey's contribution to my album "Daybreak" was nothing short of fantastic. As the producer, each
                track was approached with precision and creativity that elevated the entire project. His mastery of
                arrangements from the string quartet, electric guitar, drum charts, bass, and saxophone charts ensured
                each song stayed true to what it was. Tim's high level of organisational skills ensured a smooth and
                efficient workflow on a tight schedule. Tim's suggestions added layers of brilliance to the songs and
                made the album possible. Working with Tim was a pleasure; his dedication, talent, and professionalism
                shine in every aspect of his work. I highly recommend him to fellow singer-songwriters seeking to take
                their music to the next level”<br> <i>– <b>Emily Daye</b>, singer-songwriter</i>

            <div style="text-align: right; color: #BABABA;">
                “I would like to point out all the reasons why one should seek the musical services of the very talented
                Tim Lukey. Why? Because firstly Tim has the patience of a saint when it comes to working with him in his
                studio, and patience is crucial when trying to get the best results from a session.
                Although Tim’s primary instrument is guitar, he is well versed on keyboards, bass guitar, great at
                programming drums
                and has a vocal range that suits excellent harmonies as well as lead vocals. If you are after a
                musician/producer/arranger and sound engineer… Tim can offer you the full deluxe package!
                Tim can map out any original or cover song you’re seeking to record into a detailed Sibelius written
                chart.
                I’ve been witness to his excellent ability to write in beautiful string parts or any
                extra mandolin or piano parts or any extra instrument you may seek to have in your arrangement.
                A session with Tim is always time effective as he is very quick to put your arrangement together as he
                knows his way around his studio equipment like the back of his hand so if you need a quick turnaround he
                can deliver that.
                Lastly, I’ve worked with Tim over the past 2 years on many songs and he never ceases to amaze me…he
                loves what he does and is always willing to go that extra mile to get the best results”

                "Tim Lukey is a musician of extraordinary talent and range. His work over many years with the Preston
                Symphony Orchestra ranges from solo performer to composer, while he also took the lead with a children's
                community music project in partnership with Preston Library. He is a consummate guitarist, displaying
                musicality and technical brilliance across a variety of styles. His compositions for the orchestra have
                featured vocalists, percussion and in one case, involved live accompaniment to the screening of a
                Charlie Chaplin film. The orchestra most recently engaged Tim as soloist in Nigel Westlake’s Antarctica
                Suite, to great acclaim from the capacity audience."
